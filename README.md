This program intially asks the user for a number. 

It then runs a for loop through 5 iterations.

The first number is the iteration number.

The second is the sum of the input number + 25.

The third is the remainder of that sum divided by 3. 

The fourth number is the sum of the first three numbers.

The last number after the loop has concluded is the sum of all the fourth numbers.
